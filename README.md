# Highlites

__The application is meant for windows tablet, laptops with touch screen and pc with windows 11 connected to large tv screens.__
__Home button on the app provides access to help / documentation.__
__There is no address bar, goto Search > Search Engine > Lookup website > Click on link !.__
__Also, there is no need for app download / update, you are directly accessing the website with full functionality.__

__Note:__
If you are using a normal laptop, I suggest you use Chrome / Edge / Firefox / Brave. You will find it more cumbersome to use this.

Source code is in beta stage and the code is the first version.

This is a public repo, so as of now you can open bugs against the product and features.

You can also make queries, requests, comments, provide suggestions and feedback. 

Code is written in c# and in vs2022 and makes use of webview2.

__Prerequisites:__ (Please install them)
- .net desktop runtime 6.0
- .net framework 4.7.2
