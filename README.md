__The application is meant for windows tablet, laptops with touch screen and pc with windows 11 connected to large tv screens.__\
__Home button on the app provides access to help / documentation.__\
__There is no address bar, goto Search > Search Engine > Lookup website > Click on link !.__\
__Also, there is no need for app download / update, you are directly accessing the website with full functionality.__

Current version : 2.0.0 beta

__Note:__
If you are using a normal laptop, I suggest you use Chrome / Edge / Firefox / Brave. You will find it more cumbersome to use this in version 1.0.0. However in version 2.0.0, there is an option to use 'open in system browser". Also there is cycle through tabs and switch to previous tabs makes laptop use better. 

Source code is in beta stage and the code is the version 2.0.0, slightly better but still in beta.

This is a public repo, so as of now you can open bugs against the product and features.

You can also make queries, requests, comments, provide suggestions and feedback. 

Code is written in c# and in vs2022 and makes use of webview2.
